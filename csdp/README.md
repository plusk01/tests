CDSP: A C-implementation of an SDP Solver
=========================================

A semidefinite program (SDP) is an optimization with a linear objective, linear constraints, and a positive (negative) semidefinite constraint. Note that the optimization is performed over the space of symmetric matrices. SDPs are a subset of convex optimization.
