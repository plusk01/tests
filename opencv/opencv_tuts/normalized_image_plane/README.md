Normalized Image Coordinates
============================

Remember that `K*features_in_pixels` yields `features_on_normalized_image_plane`. Also: `fx(px) = fx(mm)/pixel_size(um) = fx(mm) * x_resolution(px)/sensor_width(mm)`.

Click on a spot in the camera and see the undistorted point -- i.e., the point on the normalized image plane.
