Arduino/Python Simple Communication
===================================

Simple example of communicating via UART from Python to Teensy/Arduino. This is not the most efficient and wouldn't support multiple message types at different update frequencies (for this see e.g., [teensyimu](https://github.com/plusk01/teensyimu)), but is fine for simple tasks.
